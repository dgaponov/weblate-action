# weblate-action

## Getting Started

To use `weblate-action` you'll need to set up a few things:

1. Create a GitHub account to use for bot
activity. This will be the account login and
profile photo that you'll see when the bot
comments on a pull request.

2. Add the GitHub bot account to your project as a collaborator.
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/settings/collaboration`.
Be sure to accept the invite email! This will enable the bot
to set PR statuses.

3. [Create a personal access token for the
GitHub bot account](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
The access token must at least have the `public_repo` scope
enabled.

4. In the Actions secrets for your repository,
set the personal access token as repository
secret called `WEBLATE_BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

5. Create a new Weblate project without components.
Create a user in Weblate and give them full access rights to the new project.

6. Get an API token for a new user in Weblate and set it in the Actions secrets
of your repository as repository secret called `WEBLATE_TOKEN`.

7. Add workflow to your repository. For example, `.github/workflows/i18n-check.yml`:

    ```
    name: i18n-check

    on:
    push:
        branches:
        - main
        paths:
        - "src/i18n-keysets/**"
    workflow_dispatch:
    # pull_request_target is needed instead of just pull_request
    # because secret is needed to sync with weblate
    # Attention! Read more at https://nathandavison.com/blog/github-actions-and-the-threat-of-malicious-pull-requests
    pull_request_target:
        branches:
        - main
        paths:
        - "src/i18n-keysets/**"

    jobs:
    i18n_check:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: github.actor != 'WeblateGravity' # Ignore pull requests from bot
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            with:
            ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

        - name: Verifying changes with Weblate
            uses: dgaponov/weblate-action@v1.17.0
            with:
                SERVER_URL: "http://SOME_WEBLATE_SERVER_URL" # Weblate server URL
                TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WEBLATE_TOKEN }}
                PROJECT: "project_slug"
                GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WEBLATE_BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```
